Notes for BIND 9.17.9
---------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``ipv4only.arpa`` is now served when DNS64 is configured. :gl:`#385`

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- It is now possible to transition a zone from secure to insecure mode
  without making it bogus in the process; changing to ``dnssec-policy
  none;`` also causes CDS and CDNSKEY DELETE records to be published, to
  signal that the entire DS RRset at the parent must be removed, as
  described in :rfc:`8078`. :gl:`#1750`

- When using the ``unixtime`` or ``date`` method to update the SOA
  serial number, ``named`` and ``dnssec-signzone`` silently fell back to
  the ``increment`` method to prevent the new serial number from being
  smaller than the old serial number (using serial number arithmetics).
  ``dnssec-signzone`` now prints a warning message, and ``named`` logs a
  warning, when such a fallback happens. :gl:`#2058`

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Multiple threads could attempt to destroy a single RBTDB instance at
  the same time, resulting in an unpredictable but low-probability
  assertion failure in ``free_rbtdb()``. This has been fixed. :gl:`#2317`

- ``named`` no longer attempts to assign threads to CPUs outside the CPU
  affinity set. Thanks to Ole Bj√∏rn Hessen. :gl:`#2245`

- When reconfiguring ``named``, removing ``auto-dnssec`` did not turn
  off DNSSEC maintenance. This has been fixed. :gl:`#2341`

- The report of intermittent BIND assertion failures triggered in
  ``lib/dns/resolver.c:dns_name_issubdomain()`` has now been closed
  without further action. Our initial response to this was to add
  diagnostic logging instead of terminating ``named``, anticipating that
  we would receive further useful troubleshooting input. This workaround
  first appeared in BIND releases 9.17.5 and 9.16.7. However, since
  those releases were published, there have been no new reports of
  assertion failures matching this issue, but also no further diagnostic
  input, so we have closed the issue. :gl:`#2091`
